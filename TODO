Dynamic RSZ Deserializer


Steps:

Load rszdump to HashMap or just plain json
needs to index the map with both original type and 

RSZ data:
    provide file bytes
    read file header
    get roots
    get type descriptors
    get external slots info (link to other files)
    rest is data

RSZ data to json
    read whole file into RszDump maps
    use type info crc or hash to find the struct
    loop throught the fields and read to blanket struct

struct RszField {
    align: u8,
    array: bool
    name: String,
    native: bool, // almost always false, except for some via types
    original_type: String, //should also be used to index other structs
    size: u8,
    type: String, //basic type of the struct
}
